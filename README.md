Searching for VA approved condos is currently very inefficient and difficult. My partner Erik and I created OscarMike Condos (OMC) to address these deficiencies. OMC allows users to see which condos currently listed for sale are VA approved. Our interface includes the ability to search for condos by location and other real estate parameters. Though a VA approved condo list currently exists on VA.gov, we provide a superior user experience and a more robust search ability. Currently, we are one of less than a handful of sites that provides this type of information.

OMC currently is in its proof of concept stage. We hope to refine our backend scraping of the VA website for more useable results in the near term. Eventually, we hope to gain access to the VA's database that contains the condo approval information and cross reference that with the actual MLS listing.
